## Workshop {Flox_0}
  Let me demonstrate the capabilities of Flox by setting up the ClamAV antivirus engine along with Cowsay in a properly configured isolated environment.

## Disclaimer

**Important:** Kindly install Flox in your machine before jump into the Workshop

Let's start,
 
  1. create a directory  :

  ```bash

```  
2. Initialize Flox in This Directory

```bash
flox init
```
3. gonna  install ClamAV and Cowsay

```bash

```
4. ðŸ”’ Let's Activate the Isolated Shell

5. Run this command to check does it work
```bash 
 clamscan / | cowsay -f dragon
```
```bash 
by using the cowsay -cowsay -l {List all available art}
```

or 
Download my pre-configured isolated env from the Floxhub

**just two steps After creating a Directory**
